# universal_store

In recent years, people have been doing more and more of their shopping online, which means that smaller physical stores without an online presence have been seeing less consumer traffic. This semester, we created the Universal Store app to help alleviate that problem. The Universal Store enables physical stores to display their inventory in an app. Customers can browse for particular products and can receive targeted promotions based on their shopping history. The Universal Store also serves as a shopping cart interface allowing customers to scan in-store items and checkout in the app. This makes the in-person shopping experience much more convenient, and at the same time encourages valuable customers to shop at physical stores.

## Git practices

Commits:
1. Create a new branch for each major task
2. Commit early and often
3. Write purposeful commit messages

Merging:
1. Master branch is for production ready code. Do not edit master directly. 
2. Issue a merge request and have someone look over your changes prior to merging to master.
3. If possible, squash your commits to a single message prior to merging into master

Rebase:
1. Only rebase your personal branch
2. Never rebase master or shared branches
