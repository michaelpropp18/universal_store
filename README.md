# universal_store

A new Flutter project.

## Git practices

Commits: 
1. Create a new branch for each major task
2. Commit early and often
3. Write purposeful commit messages

Merging:
1. Master branch is for production ready code. Do not edit master directly. 
2. Issue a merge request and have someone look over your changes prior to merging to master.
3. If possible, squash your commits to a single message prior to merging into master

Rebase:
1. Only rebase your personal branch
2. Never rebase master or shared branches
